## Topic of the practice work
The project represents a draft version of the Home page for the website that I am developing for my relatives.
Other pages will be finished during December. In addition to the static website elemetns, dynamic "About" containers
have been added. There is an "Edit Mode" that allows for manipulatation of the data in those containers. The data is loaded from custom MongoDB collections and is updated by sending GET, PUT and DELETE HTTP requests to the server. The server is hosted using Deta.sh.
## Detailed description
IN PROGRESS
### Time track
The current version of the application was done in approximately four days:
- Day 1: Home page mockup with HTML and CSS
- Day 2: Server programming and updating UI
- Day 3: Client side programming and Edit Mode programming
- Day 4: Publishing the appication; finishing the Edit Mode; polishing and commenting the code
### Strengths
- Clean code
- Versatile
- Resusable
### Weaknesses
- Code might need to be split into several files (code regions are implemented though)
- CSS styles should be optimized; not compatible with mobile screens
## Own assesment
Most of the topics covered during the lectures are included into this project and implemented in a proper way.
In my opinion, the work should be sufficient for the full 2/2 grade.
