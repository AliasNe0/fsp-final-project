# Topic of the practice work
The project represents a draft version of the Home page for the website that I am developing for my relatives.
Other pages will be finished during December. In addition to the static website elemetns, dynamic "About" containers
have been added. There is an "Edit Mode" that allows to manipulate the data in those containers. The data is loaded from
MongoDB. The server side is implemented with using Seta.sh. The application uses GET, PUT and DELETE HTTP requests.
# Detailed description
IN PROGRESS
# Time track
The current version of the application was done in three days, but it still requires polishing (code commenting!).
# Strength
- Clean code
- Versatile
- Resusable
# Weaknesses
- Code might need to be split into several files
- CSS styles could be done smarter and more deatailed
# Own assesment
Most of the topics covered during the lectures are included into this project and implemented in a proper way.
In my opinion, the work should be sufficient for the full 2/2 grade.
